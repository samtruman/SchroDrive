## Core Team

| Name | GitHub | Role | Contact |
|------|--------|------|---------|
| **Joseph Shenton** | [@moderniselife](https://github.com/moderniselife) | Creator & Maintainer — architecture, providers, automation engine, WebDAV bridges, indexer integrations, SQLite persistence, release engineering | [joe@deiterate.com](mailto:joe@deiterate.com) / [joe@shenton.email](mailto:joe@shenton.email) |

Joseph is the original author of SchröDrive and reviews every pull request. All major subsystems — the provider abstraction, the 3-phase dead-torrent repair, the fake qBittorrent *arr bridge, the WebDAV bridge and organiser — were introduced by Joseph.
